# Survey

For a long time, there has been a rather rigid idea of what the ideal academic career path for someone who studied physics should look like: **Graduate → complete a master's degree → earn a PhD → do one or two postdocs → secure a permanent position as a researcher or professor.**

Any other trajectory — slower, faster, with breaks, changes of direction, or outside academia — is often seen as "a deviation." But in practice, many of us have changed fields, countries, or languages; have taken breaks for personal reasons (children, health, migration); have left academia or entered it later; have worked as technicians, teachers, programmers, entrepreneurs, translators, science communicators, caregivers, freelancers...  

Rarely is the diversity of career paths after completing a pregrade study in Physics documented, recognized, or made visible.  

**What do we aim for with this survey?** To shed light on the many possible paths Cuban physicists have followed after graduation. Not to judge or compare, but to understand, learn from, and narrate this diversity.

This is a collective, initial, and flexible attempt. Your responses — simple or complex — are always very valuable.

### Participation and Confidentiality

Participation in this project is completely voluntary. All responses collected through surveys or interviews will be treated with strict confidentiality. You are free to skip any question you do not wish to answer.

We do **not** collect personal identifiers (such as full names, IP addresses, or contact information). The data will be used solely for academic and analytical purposes within the scope of this project. Aggregated results and anonymized narratives may be included in reports, visualizations, or publications — but never in a way that could identify individual participants.

If you have questions about data handling, please contact the research team at: [scatteringcimarron@gmail.com](mailto:scatteringcimarron@gmail.com)
