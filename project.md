## Project Overview

The **Faculty of Physics** at the **University of Havana** traces its origins back to the **1962 University Reform**, which led to the creation of the School of Physics as part of the Faculty of Sciences. This marked a turning point, granting Physics recognition as an **independent academic discipline**, distinct from the previously unified specialties of Physical-Mathematical and Physical-Chemical Sciences, which had been present in the university’s curriculum since the early 20th century. In **1984**, the School of Physics was elevated to the rank of Faculty, establishing itself as a national reference in scientific training. 

Nevertheless, the development of physics education in Cuba is not limited to the University Havana. In **1967** the foundations for a School of Physics were laid at the **University of Oriente**, while at the **Central University “Marta Abreu” of Las Villas**, the Physics degree program began in **1959** as part of the newly founded Faculty of Sciences, and evolved within various faculty structures, ultimately becoming part of the current Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science in **1988**. In **1987**, the **Institute of Higher Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTEC)** was founded, offering curricula in Nuclear Physics, Radiochemistry, and Nuclear Engineering.

Over the past 60 years, those institutions has produced hundreds of graduates. To them we must add another key group: the one formed by the Cuban students that, beginning in the early **1960s**, pursued studies at universities in the **Soviet Union** and other countries of the **former socialist bloc**. Upon their return, these graduates became part of the **first generations of professors** at the newly founded physics faculties throughout the country, playing a pivotal role in shaping Cuba’s scientific and academic landscape during a formative era.

Over time, some Cuban physicists have remained in academia, while others have transitioned into different sectors, taking their training to new contexts. Understanding these diverse journeys — and what drives them — is the central aim of this project.

## **Origins of the Research Idea**

This project began as a **personal and academic curiosity**: *What happens to Physics graduates in Cuba? Where are they now? Have they continued in academia? If not, why did they leave, and when?*

From this question emerged the idea to systematically examine the **academic and professional paths** of Physics graduates. Beyond enrollment and graduation statistics, we are interested in the **motivations behind choosing this career** and the factors that shape long-term decisions.

The project seeks to answer questions like:

- What drives students to choose Physics?  
- Do early dreams and expectations influence persistence in academia?  
- Are there gender-based patterns in career choices or academic departures?  
- What role do social, personal, and economic factors play?

## **Methodology**

We use a **mixed-methods approach**, combining quantitative data with qualitative insights. Our methodology includes:

- Document review of academic records  
- Semi-structured interviews with alumni  
- Online surveys for broader data collection  
- Statistical analysis and thematic categorization to identify patterns

## **Feasibility and Scope**

The relatively small number of Cuban physicists and its defined graduation period (since **1962**) make this study **feasible**. With careful outreach, it is possible to locate and engage with a significant number of graduates. The creation of a **database** will support both this and future research stages.

## **Preliminary Results: Promotions from 2010 to 2024**

Our initial data collection has focused on graduates from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Havana between **2010 to 2024**, using information gathered from the **Book of Graduates** of the University of Havana and **professional and social networks**. While this data is not exhaustive, it already reveals notable diversity in career paths and migration patterns. 

These preliminary results offer a **first glimpse** of the project's potential to document and analyze the real-life implications of studying Physics in Cuba.
